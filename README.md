# 🥋 Street Fighter Style 2D Fighting Game

A classic 2D two-player fighting game developed using Python, Pygame, and Pyglet. This project replicates the arcade-style street fighting experience with character movement, health tracking, and win/loss logic — all controlled by keyboard inputs.

## 🚀 Features:-

- 🎮 2-player combat system using keyboard controls
- 🔁 Auto-restart after win/loss
- 💥 Real-time collision detection
- ❤️ Dynamic health bars for both players
- 🎹 Responsive keyboard event handling
- 🎨 Pixel-style background and character graphics
- 🧠 Written with clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:-
-Python 3

-Pygame (for game loop, events, rendering)

-Pyglet (for audio and lightweight media handling)

-Visual Studio Code (IDE for development)

-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-Keyboard Event Handling

-Collision Detection Algorithms

## 🎮 Controls:-

| Player | Movement        | Attack Keys |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| 🧍 Player 1 | Arrow Keys ←↑↓→ | (Assign if any) |
| 🧍 Player 2 | W A S D           | (Assign if any)
