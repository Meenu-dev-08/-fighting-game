# 🥋 Street Fighter Style 2D Fighting Game

This project is a 2D street-fighter-style game built using Python libraries like pygame and pyglet. It features two-player keyboard-controlled combat with basic movements, collision detection, health tracking, and auto-reset functionality after a match ends.Designed as a prototype, the game showcases real-time event handling, graphical interface management, and logic-driven win/loss mechanics. The main objective is to demonstrate skills in game development, Python programming, and interactive visual design using open-source libraries.
The game enables two users to engage in dynamic combat using keyboard controls. Each player can perform attacks, dodge, and move freely within the game arena. The fight continues until one player's health reaches zero, upon which the game declares a winner and automatically resets for a new match.

**This project serves as a demonstration of core game logic implementation and 2D animation using open-source Python libraries. It helped strengthen my skills in**:-

-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-Frame-by-frame animation handling

-Keyboard event processing

-Collision-based interaction logic

-Modular coding practices

-Ideal for beginners and enthusiasts, this game can be expanded with features like background music, character selection, advanced attack combos, or even network multiplayer in future iterations.


## 🚀 Features:-

- 🎮 2-player combat system using keyboard controls
- 🔁 Auto-restart after win/loss
- 💥 Real-time collision detection
- ❤️ Dynamic health bars for both players
- 🎹 Responsive keyboard event handling
- 🎨 Pixel-style background and character graphics
- 🧠 Written with clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:-
-Python 3

-Pygame (for game loop, events, rendering)

-Pyglet (for audio and lightweight media handling)

-Visual Studio Code (IDE for development)

-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-Keyboard Event Handling

-Collision Detection Algorithms

## 🎮 Controls:-

| Player | Movement        | Attack Keys |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| 🧍 Player 1 | Arrow Keys ←↑↓→ | (Assign if any) |
| 🧍 Player 2 | W A S D           | (Assign if any)
